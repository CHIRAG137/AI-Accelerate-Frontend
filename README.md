# 🤖✨ TasteAI Studio

**Create, customize, and integrate powerful AI chatbots in minutes.**  
_No code, full intelligence — that’s TasteAI Studio._

---

## 🌟 Inspiration

The inspiration for **TasteAI Studio** came from observing a common challenge across businesses — the complexity and cost of implementing intelligent chatbots.  

Teams were either stuck with rigid, rule-based bots or needed expensive developers to build custom solutions.  
We envisioned a platform where **anyone—from small businesses to enterprise teams—could create sophisticated AI-powered chatbots without writing a single line of code.**

We wanted to leverage **Google Chrome Built- In APIs(primarily Summarisation API) and Elastic's hybrid search capabilities** combined with **Google Cloud's cutting-edge generative AI** to build something transformative —  
a conversational agent that doesn’t just match keywords but **truly understands context**, learns from diverse data sources, and adapts to different use cases.

> 🎯 **Goal:** Democratize AI-powered customer support, internal knowledge management, and interactive experiences.

## 💬 What It Does

**TasteAI Studio** is an end-to-end platform for creating, deploying, and managing intelligent AI chatbots with advanced hybrid search and conversational capabilities.

### 🎨 Bot Creation Workflow

![TasteAI Studio Bot Creation Workflow](https://res.cloudinary.com/dlpozcdw7/image/upload/v1761146859/TasteAI1_gifibw.jpg)

#### 1. Basic Information & Training Data

Users start by filling a simple form with:

- **Bot name and description** to define the bot's identity  
- **File upload (PDF, documents)** for training data  

Uploaded files are processed and sent to **Google Cloud Gemini** to automatically generate relevant Q&A pairs.  
Questions are embedded using **Vertex AI (textembedding-gecko)** and stored in **Elasticsearch** for lightning-fast semantic search.

---

#### 2. Website & Content Scraping

- Enter a website URL  
- Our intelligent crawler automatically discovers and lists all subpages/URLs  
- Users select specific pages for training  
- Selected URLs are scraped and processed by Gemini to generate contextual Q&A pairs  
- Questions and embeddings are indexed in Elasticsearch using hybrid search mappings

---

#### 3. Voice Configuration

- Enable voice input for hands-free interaction  
- Users can speak their questions via microphone  
- Perfect for accessibility and mobile-first experiences  

---

#### 4. Language Support

- Multi-language support for global accessibility  
- Bot creators select supported languages  
- Enables international deployment and diverse user bases  

---

#### 5. Persona & Behavior

Define the bot's personality and communication style:

- **Professional** for B2B  
- **Fun & Engaging** for kids  
- **Empathetic** for healthcare  

Ensures responses match the target audience and use case.

---

#### 6. Slack Integration

- Direct Slack channel integration for team collaboration  
- Add channel ID and connect via OAuth  
- Bot becomes available in the Slack workspace instantly  

---

#### 7. Conversational Flow Builder

- Visual flow designer for guided conversations  
- Create multi-step interactions (e.g., collect name → email → phone → show options → execute custom logic)  
- Combine structured flows with AI-powered Q&A  
- Ideal for lead generation, surveys, and onboarding

## 🚀 Post-Creation Features

Once a bot is created, users get access to six powerful functionalities:

- AI-powered session summaries generated by **Gemini**  
- Track bot performance and user interactions  

---

### 4. Edit Bot

- Modify bot configuration anytime  
- Update training data, persona, languages, or conversational flows  
- Re-index content in Elasticsearch seamlessly  

---

### 5. Test Bot

- Built-in testing interface  
- Validate bot responses before deployment  
- Ensure quality and accuracy  

---

### 6. Delete Bot

- Clean removal of bots no longer needed  
- Complete cleanup from database and Elasticsearch indexes  

---

## 🧠 How We Built It

### Google Chrome Built In-API - Summarisation API

The Summarisation API helped in Summarising the chat sessions without use of Paid APIs therefore cutting cost in platforms where its supported else we used the Gemini to summarise the chat sessions where its not supported. 

### 🔍 Elastic Stack – The Search Foundation

Elasticsearch powers our **hybrid knowledge retrieval system**, providing enterprise-grade search capabilities.

**Hybrid Search Architecture:**

- **Vector Similarity Search:** Dense vector embeddings (1536D from Google Cloud's `textembedding-001`)  
- **BM25 Keyword Search:** Full-text keyword relevance  
- **Weighted Scoring:** Combines semantic understanding with exact keyword matching  

# 🚀 Why Elasticsearch?

- ⚡ **Sub-second query response times**
- 🔍 **Relevance via hybrid scoring**
- 📈 **Scalable multi-tenant architecture**
- 🧩 **Real-time indexing**

---

# ☁️ Google Cloud Platform – The AI Brain

Google Cloud’s **Vertex AI** powers our intelligent conversational capabilities.

---

## 🤖 Gemini 2.5 Pro – Generative AI

- Automatic Q&A generation from PDFs or web pages  
- Contextual response generation when no exact match  
- Session summarization  
- Multi-turn context retention

---

## 🧬 Vertex AI Embeddings (`textembedding-001`)

- Semantic understanding through 1536D embeddings  
- Language-agnostic and consistent across training/query time

---

# 🔍 Hybrid Search + Generative AI Pipeline

1. User asks a question → **Vertex AI** generates an embedding  
2. **Elasticsearch hybrid search** retrieves top-5 results  
   - **High confidence** → exact match  
   - **Low confidence** → **Gemini synthesizes a contextual answer**  
3. **Conversation context** is maintained across messages
